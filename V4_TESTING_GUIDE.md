# V4 Testing Guide

**Network**: Sepolia Testnet  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Integrated & Ready for Testing

---

## üéØ What Changed in V4?

### Smart Contract Updates
1. **Project-Level TGE Activation**
   - Instead of activating each order individually, TGE is now activated once per project
   - More gas efficient (no loops)
   - Permissionless settlement after activation
   - Custom settlement windows per project

2. **Collateral Whitelist**
   - Only approved tokens can be used as collateral
   - Initially: USDC ‚úÖ USDT ‚úÖ
   - Admin can add/remove approved tokens
   - Prevents malicious/fake token usage

3. **Configurable Fees**
   - Settlement fee: 0.5% (default, configurable 0-5%)
   - Cancellation fee: 0.1% (default, configurable 0-5%)
   - Owner can adjust via admin panel
   - Fees collected to protocol wallet

4. **Security Enhancements**
   - CEI pattern enforced (Checks-Effects-Interactions)
   - SafeTransferLib for robust ERC20 handling
   - 18-decimal enforcement for project tokens
   - Decimals-aware MAX_ORDER_VALUE

### Frontend Updates
1. **contracts.ts**
   - Now imports `EscrowOrderBookV4ABI`
   - V4 configuration and comments updated

2. **TGESettlementManager.tsx**
   - Uses `activateProjectTGE(projectId, tokenAddress, settlementWindow)`
   - Batch activation applies to entire project (not per-order)
   - Individual order activation removed

3. **TGEOrderControls.tsx**
   - Individual TGE activation disabled (V4 requires project-level)
   - User redirected to admin panel for TGE activation

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Network mismatch"
**Solution:** Ensure MetaMask is on Sepolia (Chain ID 11155111)

### Issue 2: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution:** Check you have USDC/USDT and ETH for gas

### Issue 3: "Contract not found"
**Solution:** Verify `.env.local` has correct contract addresses

### Issue 4: "activateProjectTGE not found"
**Solution:** Re-run `./v4-integration-report.sh` to verify V4 ABI is loaded

### Issue 5: Orders not appearing
**Solution:** 
- Check order has collateral (status filtering)
- Verify you're viewing correct project
- Check wallet is connected

### Issue 6: TGE activation fails
**Solution:**
