# 🐛 Bug Fixes - Batch 1 (Critical Issues)

## ✅ **FIXED - Deployed to GitHub**

### **🔴 Program Issue #1: `depositTokensForSettlement` not found**

**Error:**
```
Function "depositTokensForSettlement" not found on ABI
```

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend was calling V3 function names
- V4 uses simplified settlement flow: `Approve → settleOrder`

**Fix:**
- ✅ Replaced `depositTokensForSettlement` with `settleOrder`
- ✅ Removed `claimTokens` (V4 auto-delivers on settlement)
- ✅ Updated button labels: "Deposit Tokens" → "Settle Order"
- ✅ Added spinner animations during approval/settlement

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/TGEOrderControls.tsx`

**Commit:** `2fee90c`

### **🔴 Program Issue #2: TGE Activation Failure for Points Projects**

**Error:**
```
Transaction failed: 0x606a71f8dbc1351bf2223f8f23b923f1afae9d2fabf019f1a382f3b952a24709
```

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend sent wrong POINTS_SENTINEL address: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead`
- Contract expects: `0x602EE57D45A64a39E996Fa8c78B3BC88B4D107E2`
- This is computed: `address(uint160(uint256(keccak256("otcX.POINTS_SENTINEL.v4"))))`

**Fix:**
- ✅ Updated POINTS_SENTINEL to correct address
- ✅ Added comment explaining how it's computed
- ✅ TGE activation now works for both Points and Token projects

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/components/TGESettlementManager.tsx`

**Commit:** `04ca1d0`

## 🟡 **IN PROGRESS - UI Issues**

### **UI Issue #1: Order Sorting**

**Problem:** Orders sorted by order ID instead of best price

**Expected:**
- **Buy orders**: Highest price first (best for sellers)
- **Sell orders**: Lowest price first (best for buyers)

**Status:** 🔄 Next to fix

---

### **UI Issue #2: Price History Chart Ordering**

**Problem:** Chart ordered by order number instead of time

**Expected:** Time-based ordering (when transactions filled)

**Status:** 🔄 Next to fix

---

### **UI Issue #3: Chart Disappearing**

**Problem:** Chart disappears after certain number of transactions

**Status:** 🔄 Next to fix

---

### **UI Issue #4: Settlement Warning Visibility**

**Problem:** "You have X orders in settlement" not visible enough

**Expected:** Glowing warning sign, more prominent

**Status:** 🔄 Next to fix

---

### **UI Issue #5: Approval Spinner Missing**

**Problem:** No loading indicator during token approval throughout site

**Expected:** Spinner/wheel showing "Approving token..." everywhere

**Status:** ✅ **PARTIALLY FIXED** - Added to TGEOrderControls
**Remaining:** Add to other approval flows

---

### **UI Issue #6: Error Messages for Canceled Approvals**

**Problem:** Error messages printed to dashboard when approval canceled aren't user-friendly

**Expected:** Clean, actionable error messages

**Status:** 🔄 Next to fix

---
